        <div class="line"></div>
        <p class="para">My hobby is to read fantasy, fiction, sci-fi and novels in my free time. When I have free time during school, after school, or even before school I like to read books. I am 13 years old and also in the 8th grade. A few years back I learned how good reading is, if its for school or not. I've always had a love for books. I think reading books can help me develop good skills and patience for my great life ahead. It can also increase my vocabulary and its a great past time. It helps me be more creative and imaginitive.
